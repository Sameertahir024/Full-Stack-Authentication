# Full Stack Authentication App

This is a full stack authentication application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The application provides a secure way to authenticate users, allowing them to register, login, and manage their accounts.

**Features:**

- User registration with email and password
- User login with email and password
- Password hashing and salting for secure storage
- Token-based authentication for secure access
- User account management (update profile, change password)

**Technologies Used:**

- Node.js as the server-side runtime environment
- Express.js as the web framework
- MongoDB as the NoSQL database
- Mongoose as the ORM for MongoDB
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for token-based authentication
- Bcrypt for password hashing and salting
- Dotenv for environment variable management

**How to Run:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Start the application by running `node server/index.js`.
4. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

**Note:**

This is a basic implementation of a full stack authentication app and should not be used in production without further security enhancements and testing.
